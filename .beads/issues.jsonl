{"id":"worktree-v2-8h9.5","title":"AuthBackend (Real, Mock, DryRun)","description":"Create AuthBackend protocol with Real, Mock, and DryRun implementations.\n\n## Why this was missed\n\nThe Backends epic (PR #2) implemented Docker, Git, Terminal, and Factory backends but skipped AuthBackend. The authenticate step already exists in the Planner (planner.py:102-112) and Executor (executor.py:43 maps \"authenticate\" to AUTHENTICATING state), but there is no backend to actually perform the auth operations. Without this, the executor StepHandler has no concrete auth implementation to call.\n\n## Protocol methods\n\nAuthBackend should abstract these operations:\n- setup_git_auth(sandbox_name: str) -\u003e bool -- run gh auth setup-git inside sandbox\n- inject_token(sandbox_name: str, token: str) -\u003e bool -- write/mount GH_TOKEN into sandbox\n- validate_token(token: str, required_scopes: list[str]) -\u003e bool -- check token has needed scopes before starting agent\n- setup_ssh_key(sandbox_name: str, key_path: Path) -\u003e bool -- configure SSH key if using SSH instead of HTTPS\n\n## Implementation notes\n\n- RealAuthBackend will use DockerBackend.exec_in_sandbox() under the hood to run commands in the container -- it depends on DockerBackend being available\n- MockAuthBackend should record calls and support fail_on injection (same pattern as other mocks)\n- DryRunAuthBackend should log the commands that would be run\n- The factory (factory.py) needs to be updated to include auth in the Backends container\n- Follow the same Protocol pattern as Docker/Git/Terminal: @runtime_checkable, no __future__ annotations, quoted forward references only\n\n## Auth injection points in the workflow\n\n1. Planner creates authenticate step with params: {sandbox_name: ...} (planner.py:103-111)\n2. Executor maps \"authenticate\" action to AUTHENTICATING state (executor.py:43)\n3. The StepHandler.execute() receives this step -- needs a concrete handler that calls AuthBackend\n\n## Key consideration\n\nAuthBackend has a dependency on DockerBackend (needs exec_in_sandbox to run auth commands inside the container). This is an inter-backend dependency -- consider whether AuthBackend should take a DockerBackend in its constructor, or whether the StepHandler should mediate between them.\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n- [ ] AuthBackend protocol defined with @runtime_checkable\n- [ ] RealAuthBackend, MockAuthBackend, DryRunAuthBackend all satisfy protocol (isinstance checks)\n- [ ] MockAuthBackend records calls and supports fail_on\n- [ ] DryRunAuthBackend logs commands\n- [ ] Backends dataclass in factory.py updated to include auth field\n- [ ] create_backends() produces the correct auth backend for each mode\n- [ ] Tests in test_auth_backend.py covering all three implementations\n- [ ] Do NOT use from __future__ import annotations (FA100 is in ruff ignore)\n\n## Files to create/modify\n\n- Create: plugins/worktree-v2/scripts/backends/auth.py\n- Create: plugins/worktree-v2/scripts/tests/test_auth_backend.py\n- Modify: plugins/worktree-v2/scripts/backends/factory.py (add auth to Backends + create_backends)\n- Modify: plugins/worktree-v2/scripts/backends/__init__.py (export AuthBackend)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"Brendan Whitney","owner":"brendan.whitney@faraday.io","created_at":"2026-02-09T19:59:04.871935385Z","created_by":"Brendan Whitney","updated_at":"2026-02-09T20:26:32.180685936Z","closed_at":"2026-02-09T20:26:32.180685936Z","close_reason":"Implemented AuthBackend protocol with Real, Mock, DryRun implementations. 27 tests, lint/format clean.","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"worktree-v2-8h9.5","depends_on_id":"worktree-v2-8h9","type":"parent-child","created_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}]}
